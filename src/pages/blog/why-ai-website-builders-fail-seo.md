      <h1>Why AI Website Builders Fail at SEO</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        In 2025, you can generate a complete website in 30 seconds with AI. Durable, 10Web, Wix AI, Framer AI — pick your poison. But here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>none of those websites will rank on Google.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>The "Pretty but Invisible" Problem</h2>

      <p>AI website builders have solved the visual design problem. They can generate hero sections, feature grids, testimonial carousels, and contact forms that look professional. What they can't do is answer the question that actually matters:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "What should this website say, to whom, and why would Google care?"
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is the gap between <strong>generating a website</strong> and <strong>generating a website that ranks.</strong> Let's break down exactly what's missing.</p>

      <h2>What AI Builders Don't Do</h2>

      <h3>1. Keyword Research</h3>
      <p>When you type "build me a website about hiking boots" into Durable, it generates a page with some generic text about hiking boots. It doesn't:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Research what people actually search for ("best hiking boots for flat feet" vs "hiking boots waterproof")</li>
        <li>Analyze search volume, keyword difficulty, or commercial intent</li>
        <li>Identify long-tail opportunities that a new site can actually rank for</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Competitor Analysis</h3>
      <p>Google's algorithm is fundamentally comparative. Your page doesn't rank in a vacuum — it ranks relative to the existing top 20 results. AI builders don't:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crawl competitor sites to understand their URL structure and content architecture</li>
        <li>Analyze what keywords competitors rank for and what gaps exist</li>
        <li>Study competitor content depth, schema markup, or internal linking patterns</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Topic Clusters and Content Architecture</h3>
      <p>Modern SEO isn't about individual pages. It's about <strong>topical authority</strong> — proving to Google that your site comprehensively covers a subject. AI builders generate one-off pages with no plan for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pillar pages that target broad, high-volume keywords</li>
        <li>Cluster pages targeting long-tail variants organized around pillar topics</li>
        <li>Internal linking structure that signals topical relationships to search engines</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Programmatic SEO at Scale</h3>
      <p>The biggest SEO wins come from programmatic content — generating hundreds or thousands of pages from structured data. "Best hotels in [city]" for 500 cities. "Compare [product A] vs [product B]" for every product pair. AI builders can't do this at all.</p>

      <h2>What SEO Tools Don't Do (The Other Half)</h2>

      <p>On the flip side, dedicated SEO tools like Byword, Surfer SEO, and Frase have the opposite problem. They're great at content strategy: they'll tell you what keywords to target, what your competitors are doing, and even generate optimized content. But after that, you're on your own.</p>

      <p>You still need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build the actual website</li>
        <li>Configure Schema.org structured data</li>
        <li>Set up proper URL structures and internal linking</li>
        <li>Deploy and maintain the server</li>
        <li>Connect analytics and monitor performance</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So you end up stitching together 4-6 different tools, paying $300-800/month total, and doing all the integration work manually.</p>

      <h2>The Solution: SEO-First Website Generation</h2>

      <p>This is exactly why we built SEOplant. It's not an AI website builder with SEO sprinkled on top. It's not an SEO tool that generates content files. It's an <strong>end-to-end SEO website factory</strong>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Competitor Intelligence</strong> — Automatically crawls and analyzes the top 20 competing sites</li>
        <li><strong>SEO Strategy Engine</strong> — Generates topic clusters, keyword difficulty matrices, and 6-month content calendars</li>
        <li><strong>Programmatic Content</strong> — Template + data = hundreds or thousands of targeted pages</li>
        <li><strong>Site Factory</strong> — Builds an SEO-optimized Astro static site with Schema, llms.txt, and proper IA</li>
        <li><strong>One-Click Deploy</strong> — SSH push to your own VPS, no platform lock-in</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The result? A website that doesn't just look good — it's <strong>built to rank</strong> from day one, with the content architecture, technical SEO, and keyword targeting that search engines actually reward.</p>
